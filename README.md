# Lodgify Front End Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project showcases a widget that shows the current progress of the profile creation of the user. The user will be able to see the missing tasks of a specific area and be able to mark them as done.

## Other Technologies used

- Design System and Icons - Material UI
- Microtransactions and Animations - Framer Motion
- E2E testing - Cypress
- Unit Testing - React Testing Library + Jest

## Process

The process was to divide the whole Assignment into 3 tasks -

1. First was to manage all the UI components, coming up with the architecture and only focusing on getting the components right with mock data.
2. Second, making sure the functionalities were working fine. There were a few UI issues that were taking a while which I noted and left for later, the priority was getting the functionality to work according to the MVP.
3. Third, adding some tests for the components and an e2e test ensures that the code is working fine and can be tested anytime.
